## Introduction

This is the repository where the documentation for SCAR is collected. You will find documentation for some applications, benchmarks, lectures and workshops that we use within the research group.

## Rules
For this repository, and all the ones inside the `SCAR-EAFIT` team on GitHub you must go to [this page](https://github.com/SCAR-EAFIT/Documentations/wiki/Rules).

For this specific repository you must follow the following rules:
1. you must identify a directory to put the files in, if any of the existing directories fots to you, you can create a new one in. For example:

    If you are making a documentation for an application, you must go to the App directory and create a new directory with the name of the application. Inside the new folder you should create a file with extension `.md` with the name of the application. And at the same level, you should create an Image directory in case you need it.

2. Follow the following structure for the files:
    ```
    - Title
    - Content
    - Subject 1
    - Subject 2
    - ...
    - Subject n
    - References
    - Authors
    ```
    Every topic should be in the content; references and Authors as well.

3. In Authors you should include other people who can answer your questions about the topic you are adding, even if they do not help you write the files.

4. Avoid mixing several formats, and keep it as simple as possible, **ALWAYS**.

You can always consult the existing documentation if you have any doubts, or contact a collaborator.
